## Disclaimers and Reclaimers
The actual meat and potatoes of this stuff is the work of other fine human individuals, whose names elude me.  The Windows store apps clean up script is found here: https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater / while the Office Scrub scripts are the work of Microsoft folks and found here: https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-IT-Pro-Deployment-Scripts/tree/master/Office-ProPlus-Deployment/Remove-PreviousOfficeInstalls
